# Design-Project

This is a 5 stage incremental design project:

#### Design Stage 1: ####
A theme is chosen to start the project. Here, ***Daily Transportation***.

#### Design Stage 2: ####
A formative research report is collected from users on the selected theme through interviews and field notes.

#### Design Stage 3: ####
1. Data Analysis Diagrams are created to identify the problem:
   * Affinity diagram
   * Thematic network diagram
   Choose the diagram that best supports in obtaining the problem statement. 
2. Construct the problem statement.
3. Create user personas to understand the target customers.

#### Design Stage 4: ####
1. Various Brainstorming sessions are performed in identifying the possible design solutions. For example,
   * Asking _How-might-we_ questions
   * Gathering solutions for the _How-might-we_ questions (Individual+Group Brainstorming)
2. User Needs Summary: Identify the 5 most important issues that need to be addressed.
3. Propose 3 design solution alternatives that best satisfy the problem statement.
   * For each solution, create 2 Storyboards to obtain a visual understanding of the solution.  
4. Move forward with one design choice.

#### Design Stage 5: ####
1. Create a Prototype of the design choice. 
2. Evaluation of the prototype is conducted through Cognitive Walkthrough Report and Usability Aspect Report.
